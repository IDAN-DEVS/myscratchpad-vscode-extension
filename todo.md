# TODO:

1. extend the extension to link files to a specific workspace , so i don't want files from other workspaces to be in another workspace.
2. let's try add feature to lock files, so in order to access we need to provide a password or key .
3. Update the readme , create icons and publish the extension to the marketplace.
