2. **Create a New File**:
   - Click the "+" icon in either scratchpad view
   - Select from predefined file types (JS, TS, HTML, CSS, JSON, MD, SQL, TXT)
   - **OR** choose "Custom File" to specify any extension (py, go, java, rb, etc.)
   - Provide a name or use the auto-generated timestamped name
   - The file opens automatically with a basic template

### üîß Managing Files

### How It Works

MyScratchPad uses a shared storage system that all three editors can access. This means:

- Files created in VS Code appear instantly in Cursor and Windsurf
- Work on a file in Cursor, continue editing in VS Code
- Perfect for teams using different editors
- No manual file transfers or exports needed

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.95.0 or higher (also works with Cursor and Windsurf)
- No additional dependencies required

## Extension Settings

This extension does not contribute any VS Code settings. All configuration is handled through the intuitive UI.
